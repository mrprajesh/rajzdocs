<aside class="success"> Some say learning stops when you grow old. But, according to me Learning begins from the day we are born till the our last breath. I am making a note of whatever I had (/have been) learnt (/learning) from my undergraduate to Ph.D. (and till now!). Everyone you see in this world is here to teach you something new provided you are ready to "listen" and "willing" to learn.  </aside>

<aside class="notice" > Even a two-year old kid can teach you something new provided you are patient and willing to listen. </aside>
